The Vienna History Wiki, a large knowledge base curated by the city government in collaboration with other institutions and the general public, provides an ideal use case for demonstrating strengths and weaknesses of SMW as well as discussing the challenges of co-curation in a cultural heritage setting. This paper describes processes like collaborative editing, interlinking unique identifiers on the web, sharing data with Wikidata, making use of Schema.org, and other ontologies. It presents insights from a user survey, access statistics, and a knowledge graph analysis. This work contributes to the scarce research in wiki usage outside of the Wikipedia ecosystem as well as to the field of community-based knowledge graph curation. The availability of a now significantly improved RDF representation indicates future directions for research and practice.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/emre.12076},
	abstract = {In order to conceptualize international governmental organizations (IGOs) as powerful actors, international relations scholars increasingly resort to approaches that present these organizations as behaving like modern corporations or bureaucracies. Although we agree with the underlying assumption that it is useful to understand IGOs as organizations, we find these approaches only give partial answers. We argue that the key to a more complete understanding of international organizations is to conceptualize them not as standard forms of organizations with individuals as their members but as meta-organizations comprising organized actors as members. Meta-organizations are paradoxical constructions: autonomous actors with autonomous actors as members. An international organization is permanently competing for actorhood with its member states, and this competition has far-reaching implications for the ways they perform as agents of global governance. Meta-organization theory explains why international organizations are less powerful actors than standard organizations are-why it is more difficult for them to make decisions and to achieve coordination and organizational action. Yet international organizations are strong in other respects. Meta-organization theory explains why they are easily established, why they can place strong demands on new members, and why their existing members are slowly transformed by their membership. Overall, many international organizations are influential but in a different way than suggested by standard theories of organizations.},

Unfortunately, neither the structure nor the cost of using the memory subsystem of a computer or the caches on CPUs is well understood by most programmers.

	title = {Vers l'{OLAP} sémantique pour l'analyse en ligne des données complexes},
	abstract = {L'analyse en ligne OLAP permet une navigation interactive dans les données, une visualisation rapide de l'information et une exploration de la structure multidimensionnelle des données. Une des limites est de se restreindre à des aspects exploratoires et navigationnels. De plus, avec l'avènement des données complexes (données multi-format et/ou multi-structure et/ou multi-source et/ou multi-modale et/ou multi-version), l'analyse en ligne doit s'adapter à la nature spécifique de ces données tout en gardant l'esprit de l'OLAP. Les opérateurs OLAP sont définis pour des données classiques et sont souvent inadaptés quand il s'agit de données complexes par exemple composées de textes, images, son ou vidéos. Les limites de l'OLAP ainsi que la spécificité des données complexes nécessitent une évolution ou adaptation de l'OLAP. Il devient nécessaire de : (1) enrichir les possibilités de l'analyse OLAP en la dotant de nouvelles possibilités ; (2) créer une analyse en ligne adaptée aux données complexes ; (3) faire évoluer l'OLAP vers une analyse sémantique des données. Dans cette vaste problématique, nous choisissons de traiter les questions d'agrégation et visualisation des données complexes, de réorganisation du cube pour identifier des régions d'analyse intéressantes, et d'étendre l'OLAP à des possibilités d'explication et de prédiction. Pour toutes ces questions, nous essayons également de tenir compte de la sémantique véhiculée par les données. Pour apporter des premières solutions, nous orientons vers une combinaison des principes de l'OLAP, de la fouille de données et de la recherche d'information. Afin d'introduire une analyse explicative dans l'OLAP, nous faisons une recherche guidée de règles d'association dans le cube. Cela nous conduit à modifier la définition du support et de la confiance d'une règle. Les arbres de régression nous permettent de proposer à l'utilisateur de faire de la prédiction dans le cube et d'avoir ainsi une démarche de type What If Analysis. Pour l'analyse des données complexes, deux méthodes factorielles (AFC et ACM) rendent possible la visualisation des faits dans un cube et la détection de régions intéressantes en réorganisant les dimensions du cube. Nous proposons également une agrégation sémantique des faits et une nouvelle hiérarchie de dimension construite automatiquement grâce aux principes d'une méthode de classification (CAH). Nos propositions sont une première démonstration de la faisabilité de combiner l'OLAP à d'autres techniques comme la fouille de données et la recherche d'information pour faire significativement évoluer l'analyse en ligne et s'adapter aux données complexes. L'OLAP a commencé à s'adapter à leur structure et à leur spécificité (XOLAP - XML OLAP, SOLAP - spatial OLAP). Mais il faut aller au delà et nous pensons qu'un des défis est d'extraire et d'analyser (en ligne) la sémantique contenue dans les données complexes. Ce point constitue un véritable verrou scientifique mais qui est que partiellement abordé par la communauté scientifique. Il faudrait également identifier tous les problèmes posés par les données complexes et ce quels que soient leur nature, contexte ou spécificités. Nous voulons poursuivre nos travaux dans cette voie et faire évoluer l'OLAP vers une nouvelle génération d'analyse en ligne : l'OLAP sémantique. Les problèmes majeurs à traiter seront comment : (1) modéliser toutes les formes de données complexes, leur sémantique et leurs liens ; (2) analyser en ligne les données complexes ; (3) Intégrer les connaissances de l'utilisateur dans le processus de l'analyse ?},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to further develop the epistemological base of interventionist research (IR) as a valid accounting and management research methodology, through the identification of intervention theory and an IR framework derived from social sciences. Moreover, this paper seeks to contribute to empirical knowledge of IR through a critical review of limited empirical evidence relating to intervention theory and the extant IR frameworks derived from action research.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Texts and academic journal papers that judiciously review intervention theory, intervention research frameworks were identified systematically; along with empirical research addressing theoretical and methodological deficiencies of IR and, providing evidence to inform practical considerations when undertaking IR.
            
            
              Findings
              The key findings include rare empirical evidence addressing theoretical shortcomings and application of intervention theory, an IR framework derived from social sciences with extremely limited use in accounting and management research, deficiencies in action research oriented frameworks labelled as alternative forms of IR, an alternate perspective to positivistic validity and reliability issues and other practical considerations to facilitate the conducting of IR.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The novelty of this paper lies in the diminution of the fragmented nature of IR that undermines its scientific value through the identification of an intervention theory and IR framework experiencing extremely limited use in accounting and management research, with the exception of a cross‐disciplinary (management accounting and information systems) doctoral study, optimising IR utilisation with greater degrees of validity and reliability and, finally, a proposed alternative research design for utilisation in IR.},

	abstract = {Data warehouses are a major component of data-driven decision support systems (DSS). They rely on multidimensional models. The latter provide decision makers with a business-oriented view to data, thereby easing data navigation and analysis via On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) tools. They also determine how the data are stored in the data warehouse for subsequent use, not only by OLAP tools, but also by other decision support tools. Data warehouse design is a complex task, which requires a systematic method. Few such methods have been proposed to date. This paper presents a UML-based data warehouse design method that spans the three design phases (conceptual, logical and physical). Our method comprises a set of metamodels used at each phase, as well as a set of transformations that can be semi-automated. Following our object orientation, we represent all the metamodels using UML, and illustrate the formal specification of the transformations based on OMG's Object Constraint Language (OCL). Throughout the paper, we illustrate the application of our method to a case study.},

Based on an extensive literature review and an empirical study, we develop and evaluate a theoretical model of impact-oriented BI maturity.

This task becomes very difficult because the complexity of the current applications in particular using new technologies (e-learning, E-trade, data warehouse…) and the enormous mass of concepts coming from heterogeneous sources. These problems can generate various types of conflicts (syntactic, semantic and structural), we propose the ontology using to assist the designers during their task of modelling for a given field. In this paper, we propose an ontology building methodology to resolve their IS conflicts.

The author shows how successful change can be encouraged and facilitated for long-term success. The article compares the characteristics of Lewin's Three-Step Change Theory, Lippitt's Phases of Change Theory, Prochaska and DiClemente's Change Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior to one another. Leading industry experts will need to continually review and provide new information relative to the change process and to our evolving society and culture. here are many change theories and some of the most widely recognized are briefly summarized in this article. The theories serve as a testimony to the fact that change is a real phenomenon. It can be observed and analyzed through various steps or phases. The theories have been conceptualized to answer the question, "How does successful change happen?" Lewin's Three-Step Change Theory Kurt Lewin (1951) introduced the three-step change model. This social scientist views behavior as a dynamic balance of forces working in opposing directions. Driving forces facilitate change because they push employees in the desired direction. Restraining forces hinder change because they push employees in the opposite direction. Therefore, these forces must be analyzed and Lewin's three-step model can help shift the balance in the direction of the planned change},

	abstract = {From a transtheoretical perspective, PROCHASKA, NORCROSS and DICLEMENTE summarise prescriptive and proscriptive guidelines for improving treatments based on five stages of change the client may progress through - precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Change is not viewed as a linear progression through the stages; rather, most clients move through the stages of change in a spiral pattern. While people progress from contemplation to preparation to action to maintenance, most will relapse. Fortunately, most move back to the contemplation stage and into preparation and action. Eleven practice recommendations are advanced against the central need to assess the stage of a client's readiness for change and to tailor interventions accordingly. A small and finite set of change processes or strategies have been identified across hundreds of psychotherapy techniques and across diverse disorders. Eight change process are outlined in detail. In the transtheoretical model, change processes associated with particular therapeutic models are applied optimally at each stage of change accompanied by stage-matched 'relationships of choice'. Guidance is given on how to avoid mismatching stages and processes. Smoking is used as an illustrative problem behaviour.},

The elaboration of the assessment tool to assess the contribution to higher education and societal sustainable communities has brought researchers to discover etic and emic implications, revealing the existence of an accountability layer in which the international alliance directly engages with rural and mountain communities in marginalized areas.

However, the results obtainable by the methodologies can differ substantially in terms of schema quality and required efforts. In this paper, we provide metrics for evaluating the quality of multidimensional schemata in reference to the effort spent in the design process and the automation degree of the methodology.

This neglects the organizational role of data warehousing as a means of centralized information flow control. As a consequence, a large number of quality aspects relevant for data warehousing cannot be expressed with the current DW meta models. This paper makes two contributions towards solving these problems. Firstly, we enrich the meta data about DW architectures by explicit enterprise models. Secondly, many very different mathematical techniques for measuring or optimizing certain aspects of DW quality are being developed. We adapt the Goal-Question-Metric approach from software quality management to a meta data management environment in order to link these special techniques to a generic conceptual framework of DW quality. The approach has been implemented in full on top of the ConceptBase repository system and has undergone some validation by applying it to the support of specific quality-oriented methods, tools, and application projects in data warehousing.},

Pau is an old royal city set between the Pyrenees Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. With more than 1,900 acres of green space, Pau is one of the greenest cities in Europe. It is also home to a number of museums including the National Museum of the Castle of Pau and the Pau Museum of Fine Arts. As well as the main Pau Campus, there are four other campuses: Anglet, Bayonne, Mont-de-Marsan, and Tarbes. Each campus is fully equipped with a library, sports facilities and a range of student associations. The university is organised into three colleges: the college of sciences and technology for energy and environment, the college of social science and the humanities, and the college of European and international studies. Each college consists of two levels: undergraduate studies and graduate studies, research and innovation. There are 24 research units at the university that carry out research in the following areas: environment and material, geo-resources, aquatic environments and resources, justice and territories, and areas, borders and blending.},

The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

	abstract = {Decision support systems (DSS) are becoming increasingly more critical to the daily operation of organizations. Data warehousing, an integral part of this, provides an infrastructure that enables businesses to extract, cleanse, and store vast amounts of data. The basic purpose of a data warehouse is to empower the knowledge workers with information that allows them to make decisions based on a solid foundation of fact. However, only a fraction of the needed information exists on computers; the vast majority of a firm's intellectual assets exist as knowledge in the minds of its employees. What is needed is a new generation of knowledge-enabled systems that provides the infrastructure needed to capture, cleanse, store, organize, leverage, and disseminate not only data and information but also the knowledge of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to propose, as an extension to the data warehouse model, a knowledge warehouse (KW) architecture that will not only facilitate the capturing and coding of knowledge but also enhance the retrieval and sharing of knowledge across the organization. The knowledge warehouse proposed here suggests a different direction for DSS in the next decade. This new direction is based on an expanded purpose of DSS. That is, the purpose of DSS in knowledge improvement. This expanded purpose of DSS also suggests that the effectiveness of a DSS will, in the future, be measured based on how well it promotes and enhances knowledge, how well it improves the mental model(s) and understanding of the decision maker(s) and thereby how well it improves his/her decision making.},

To this end, we propose a typology of analog, augmented, and automated governance modes, each associated with specific control, coordination, incentive, and trust mechanisms. Additionally, we provide a heuristic for determining the optimal governance choice via the interplay of transactivity (i.e., the contributors, connections, and consistency in an exchange network) and corresponding governance costs. Our study advances the governance literature by defining digital governance as a distinct form and outlining key governance mechanisms and choices in the digital era.

Data warehouse is accepted as the heart of the latest decision support systems. Due to the eagerness of data warehouse in real life, the need for the design and implementation of data warehouse in different applications is becoming crucial. Information from operational data sources are integrated by data warehousing into a central repository to start the process of analysis and mining of integrated information and primarily used in strategic decision making by means of online analytical processing techniques (OLAP). Despite the applications of data warehousing techniques in number of areas, there is no comprehensive literature review for it.
